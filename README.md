# api-workshop
API Workshop code and material. These project are based on the [SwaggerWcf](https://github.com/abelsilva/swaggerwcf) attributes to produc a swagger.json for WCF services. All "good" swagger frameworks nowadays target the more modern WebAPI.
== Running
To run the sample, just set the Content.Host as the startup project and choose Debug / Run. At current date nothing is implemented behind the service calls (it's just a documentation demo - for now).
